# I will add my solutions here.

#get a number from user sample: 371

# identify the length of the number (3)

# you get every number one by one
# separate the numbers 3 - 7 - 1

#create a loop through the numbers and take the power of each item of the length  3**3 + 7**3 + 1**3

#check if the result is equal to given number, it is an Armstrong number 371 = 3**3 + 7**3 + 1**3
